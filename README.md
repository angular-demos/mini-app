## File Naming Convention

This project doesn't follow the traditional lowercase dot naming pattern used by the Angular CLI. 
I've opted for a CamelCase pattern that is a little easier to read. Each Angular "module" is placed 
into it's own folder, and contains a "components" folder with a directory for each component. This 
approach makes it easier to drop unused components later. It also makes the packaging of modules 
more obvious when you browse the file structure.
