# MiniApp - [MiniApp](https://angular-demos.github.io/mini-app/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular-demos/mini-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular-demos/mini-app)

This is a simple Angular application that uses a mock JSON API 
provided by [JSONPlaceHolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The application is divided into *feature* modules to handle the *users*, *posts*, *albums* 
and *to do* features. The core set of features demonstrated here are:

- require user authentication
- maintain a user session
- displays a list of blog posts for that user
- displays a list of photo albums for that user
- displays a list of to do items for that user
- provide basic searching, sorting and status filtering (for to do items)

# Demo

View this application in action at [https://angular-demos.github.io/mini-app/](https://angular-demos.github.io/mini-app/)

# Dependencies

This application was built with these key dependencies

- Angular (tested with 5.2.1)
- Bootstrap 4 (tested with 4.0.0-beta.3)
- NgBootstrap (tested with 1.0.0-beta.9)

# Installation

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed to build and run this demo. Afterwards these two CLI commands will start a local server, where by you can access the demo at `http://localhost:4200/`

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Unit Tests and E2E

This demo contains just a few tests to show how testing will be handled in the future. It
supports both unit tests and integration tests.

To run the unit tests for components:

```
npm test
```

> This will verify that the MainComponent renders the brand name "MiniApp"

To run integration tests for E2E:

```
npm run e2e
```

> This will verify that the Users module performs a log in successfully.

# Overview

This application is designed as a *read-only* example of a basic Angular application. The text shown 
in the demo is gibberish generated by the JSON end points, and none of the *write* 
operations (i.e. removing a to do item) are persisted in the back end.

## Design

This demo follows a basic Bootstrap 4 UI design with a navbar at the top and a simple layout of content. The
layout is responsive to both desktop and mobile sizes.

Here are some notable features of the UI: 

- Toast messages are embedded in the top of pages for easier mobile reading.
- Searching, sorting and filter are supported for all feature modules.
- UI components have their own feature module.
- REST, Pipes and services are in the Shared module.

## Architectural

This demo follows a common Angular feature module approach. Where by, routes define scopes for
features and those feature modules can be lazy loaded based upon demand.

Modules are described as follows:

- Main is the bootstrap module that starts the demo.
- Shared contains reusable Pipes, Components and utility classes.
- UI contains generic UX components such as Toasts and the ViewHeader.
- Albums handles the displaying of albums and photos.
- Posts handles the displaying of posts.
- Todos handles the to do items.
- Users handles log in and log out features.

While the *Users* module handles the *features* of authentication. The actual services for managing 
the current user session is in the *Shared* module. This allows other feature modules to depend
upon authentication services without requiring the *Users* module to be loaded.

## CSS and UX

This demo contains examples of responsive design. The *albums* pop up dialog that displays
*photos* organizes photos into a grid of 4x4. The size of images adjusts to changes in the 
browser widths.

The top nav bar compacts on mobile and expands on desktop. Showing a toggle button on mobile to
display more menu options.
